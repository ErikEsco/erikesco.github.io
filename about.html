		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			Currently a student at IIT in Chicago, I am very passionate about learning web design. Front-end or back-end? That is irrelevant for me. The more experience the better. I enjoy helping others because this helps me keep my knowledge in check. I have obtained great customer skills and always have a smile on my face. I am bi-lingual, being fluent in both English and Spanish. Android or Apple? Why not have the best of both worlds?
